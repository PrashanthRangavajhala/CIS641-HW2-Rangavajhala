###### Term Project
The project can be described as a beginning to a new world where doctors and patients can interact virtually and treatments can go on without much physical contact needed. Our application is basically an interface for the doctor and patient to interact with each other and by sitting in the comfort of their homes. A bright example of where our web application can be used would be the recent pandemic of Covid-19 that occurred. Our system would be perfect for such a scenario where people cannot go out of their houses to hospitals and still contact some of the best doctors around the world for the best treatment at their house itself. The project “Aayu” is secure as a vault, as fast as lightning, and as reliable as the sun. Surely if this project is implemented on a large scale it can be one of the major domains that help in a better medical infrastructure of the world and lead to a better future.
